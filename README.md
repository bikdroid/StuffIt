Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)

The Final Major project for applying Object Oriented Design Patterns like Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, in
 developing a Recipes Blogging and Sharing application, with features like
 
 1. Ingredient based relevant search
 2. Search for recipes based on health/medicinal constraints.
 
Tasks included :
 1. Development of Prototype of the idea, presentation of Use Case Text, Use Case diagrams, System Sequence Diagrams for each Use Case for the Iteration 1.
 2. Development of an Initial implementation of GUI and a semi-workable solution, with alignment with the plan of Iteration 1 and planning for the extension of any new suggested features by customer for Iteration 2. Scrutinize the design and development process to align with Agile UP. Also, included designing unit and integration tests.
 3. Iteration 2, consisting of implementation of the Search System, GUI updates, user login and security, blogging utilities, update, delete and edit options. Major Design descisions like Pattern implementations. At the end of iteration test results, and working system were presented to the customer(lecturer and classmates).
 4. Iteration 3, consisted of implementing the full and final system, and performing full integration tests.  The final system was presented to the professor.
 
 Objectives Completed:
 1. Study of OOD/OOP design patterns.
 2. Team work and collaboration.
 3. Agile UP methodology analysis and implementation.
 4. Integration and Unit testing.
 5. Developing new language, SDK and technical skills.
